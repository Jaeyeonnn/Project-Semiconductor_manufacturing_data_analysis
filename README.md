# Semiconductor Manufacturing Data - Feature Selection Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on performing feature selection on a semiconductor manufacturing process dataset to improve predictive modeling. The objective is to identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting key outcomes such as product quality or yield. The dataset consists of sensor readings and process parameters collected during the manufacturing process of semiconductor wafers from kaggle.

## Introduction
The semiconductor manufacturing process involves numerous variables, such as temperature, pressure, and chemical concentrations, which impact the final product's quality. In this analysis, I focus on selecting the most influential features from a large set of process variables to predict the final product quality. Feature selection helps to reduce model complexity, improve prediction accuracy, and decrease computational costs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains data from semiconductor manufacturing processes, with columns representing various process parameters and sensor readings but they are unknown.

- Dataset Source: 
- Size: 
- Features: 
  - Process parameters: Temperature, Pressure, Chemical concentration, etc.
  - Sensor readings: Voltage, Current, etc.
  - Target: Accurate prediction

The dataset has missing values and noise that need to be handled during the preprocessing stage.

## Methodology
To perform feature selection, I followed these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: 
   - Handled missing values using [].
   - Standardized the numerical features for better model performance.
   - Outlier detection and removal []

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized feature distributions and relationships using [].
   - Correlation analysis to identify highly correlated features.
   
3. Feature Selection Methods:
   I used several techniques to select the most important features:
   - Filter Methods: Pearson correlation, Chi-square test, etc.
   - Wrapper Methods: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Sequential Feature Selection (SFS).
   - Embedded Methods: Feature importance from tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

4. Model Training:
   - Trained multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with the selected features to evaluate their performance.

## Feature Selection
The feature selection process aimed to reduce dimensionality and identify the most predictive features. The following methods were used:

- Correlation Analysis: Highly correlated features were dropped to reduce multicollinearity.
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This method recursively removes the least important features and builds a model on the remaining features.
- Feature Importance from Random Forest: I used the feature importance from a Random Forest model to rank features based on their contribution to the predictive power.

## Results
The results of the feature selection process are as follows:

- Improvement in Model Accuracy**: After performing feature selection, model performance improved by [X]% based on accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- Key Insights: The most important features for predicting product quality are [Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.].
- Model Performance: The selected features were tested using [classification/regression model], and the following results were achieved:
  - Accuracy: [value]
  - Precision: [value]
  - Recall: [value]
  - F1-score: [value]

The models performed better with fewer features, demonstrating the effectiveness of the feature selection process.

## Conclusion
This analysis successfully identified the most relevant features that influence the semiconductor manufacturing process outcome. By reducing the number of input features, we were able to build more efficient models with improved accuracy. Feature selection is a key step in making sense of complex datasets and improving predictive performance in industrial applications.

## Technologies Used

## Future Work
